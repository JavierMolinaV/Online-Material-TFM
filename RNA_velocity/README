############# OBJECTIVE #############

This pipeline analyzes RNA velocity using Velocyto and scVelo to examine dynamic transcriptional changes in gene expression across clusters of cells. 
The RNA velocity analysis aims to predict the future state of gene expression by utilizing spliced and unspliced transcript counts.

############# STEPS ############# 

### STEP 1: Seurat Processing
Convert Seurat object data to Python/anndata format compatible with scVelo. Extract the counts matrix, metadata .csv, gene names .csv, and dimensional reduction 
information for both WT mice and IghA12/+ mice (independently). Save the extracted data and prepare them for conversion into Python/anndata format.

### STEP 2: Velocyto Processing
Process the BAM file and generate a LOOM file for RNA velocity analysis. Run Velocyto (v.0.17) on the BAM file produced by cellranger. Using the following input parameters:
filtered_barcodes.tsv from cellranger, GTF file for Mus musculus GRCm38 (excluding repetitive elements) and Mus musculus GRCm38 GTF file for gene annotation. The output is a LOOM file containing spliced, unspliced, and ambiguous counts.

### STEP 3: scVelo Processing
Perform RNA velocity analysis using scVelo and integrate the results with Seurat data. Use scVelo (v.1.26.4) in Python to load the LOOM file and the Seurat-derived anndata object. Merge the LOOM data with the Seurat anndata object using the utils.merge function. Ensure an appropriate proportion of unspliced reads (between 10% and 20%). Perform PCA and test combinations of principal components and neighbors to calculate velocity vectors. Generate 2D velocity representations and calculate the average speed and coherence of velocity vectors.
