############# OBJECTIVE ############# 
This pipeline utilizes 10x Genomics Cell Ranger v7.1.0 to process raw sequencing FASTQ files. It integrates multiple sequencing libraries including Gene Expression (GEX), 
VDJ (Immune Receptor Diversity), and HTO (Hashtag Oligonucleotide) for demultiplexing and huIgÎº cite-seq staining. The aim is to generate comprehensive multi-omics data 
that enables deep analysis of transcriptomic and immune receptor diversity, along with cell-specific barcode information and the surface expression of huIgk.
