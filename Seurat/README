############ OBJECTIVE ############

This analysis aims to perform single-cell clustering and differential gene expression analysis on bone marrow and spleen samples using Seurat. 
The goal is to identify and annotate distinct B cell subpopulations, determine cluster proportions across genotypes, and identify differentially 
expressed genes using various statistical methods. All libraries used are specified on the markdown document.
