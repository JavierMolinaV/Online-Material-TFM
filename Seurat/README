############ OBJECTIVE ############

This analysis aims to perform single-cell clustering and differential gene expression analysis on bone marrow and spleen samples using Seurat. 
The goal is to identify and annotate distinct B cell subpopulations, determine cluster proportions across genotypes, and identify differentially 
expressed genes using various statistical methods. All libraries used are specified on the markdown document and pdf documents (that have been 
divided in two due to size issues).
